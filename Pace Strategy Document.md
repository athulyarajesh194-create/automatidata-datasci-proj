# PACE Strategy Document

## Data Project Questions and Considerations

### Plan Stage

#### The Audience

The audience of our project is New York City TLC Team consisting of Juliana Soto and Titus Nelson. 

#### Goal and Impact

To create an app possibly using regression model to **predict** or **estimate** taxi fares before going for the ride based on various variables. By being able to create a model, the New York TLC can implement dynamic pricing to better match supply and demand, minimise fair disputes (increase customer trust) and thereby save time and admiminstrative costs.

#### Questions

Some questions to be considered wheen moving forward with project may include:
* What is the current condition of the dataset? Does it require excessive cleaning? Is there a need for validation checks to see for any missing or null values?
* What variables should be considered that could be useful in predicting taxi fares? Time of day? Distance? Demand level?
* What are the trends or insights that can assist in our findings?
* Have we analysed the data objectively? Are there some bias considerations?

#### Resources

Some of the resources required are hardware/software needs like:
* Python notebook software
* The dataset
* maplotlib, tabalaeu etc. that might be required depending on project progress

#### Deliverables
* Project Plan to be sent to stakeholders
* The PACE Strategy Document to be shared with the team to stream workflows
* The prepped dataset free from errors and proper structure using categorisation, aggregation methods (using EDA) etc.
* Regression analysis, appropriate machine learning model and data visualisation to gather insights

### The PACE Workflow

#### Project Tasks

1. Evaluating the model: EXECUTE STAGE
   
**Reasoning:** To check if the results of the model and respective findings are accurate to the 90% threshold is part of the execute phase.

2. Conduct hypothesis testing: ANALYSE and CONSTRUCT STAGE
   
**Reasoning:** During the analyse phase, we identify the statistical method/model to be used and its actual execution would come under construct phase

3. Begin Exploring the data: ANALYSE STAGE

**Reasoning:** Data exploration involves identifying duplicates, errors, null values, aggregation and organisation of data. Essentialy it is the general prepping of the data and it comes under the analyse phase 

4. Data Exploration and Cleaning: PLAN and ANALYSE STAGE

**Reasoning:** Planning takes place when identifying the methods needed to clean the data. Exploration and actual cleasing would be in the anlayse phase 

5. Establish structure of workflow: PLAN STAGE

**Reasoning:** To streamline workflows within members of the data team require intensive planning thereby coming under the plan phase

6. Communicate final insights with stakeholders: EXECUTE STAGE

**Reasoning:** Communicating the final insights is the final stage for any data cycle so it comes under the execute phase

7. Compute discriptive statistics: ANALYSE STAGE

**Reasoning:** To understand and get more information of the data requires EDA which comes under analyse stage

8. Visualisation building: ANALYSE and CONSTRUCT

**Reasoning:** Data assessment is required followed by its execution so it comes under analyse and construct phases

9. Write a project proposal: PLAN STAGE

**Reasoning:** To give an idea of the timeline of the  team processes to the  stakeholders, it requires planning thus coming under the plan stage

10. Build regression model: ANALYSE and CONSTRUCT STAGE

**Reasoning:** data assessment to understand which model to utilise and whether it meets the criteria and its execution requires these two phases

11. Compile Summary information about the data: ANALYSE STAGE

**Reasoning:** Inspecting data and acquiring information from it to create an overall summary comes under analyse phase

12.  Build machine learning model: CONSTRUCT STAGE

**Reasoning:** Building models is the actual execution of models so it comes under construct phase
