# PACE Strategy Document

## Data Project Questions and Considerations

### Plan Stage

#### The Audience

The audience of our project is New York City TLC Team consiting of Juliana Soto and Titus Nelson. 

#### Goal and Impact

To create an app possibly using regression model to **predict** or **estimate** taxi fares before going for the ride based on various variables. By being able to create a model, the New York TLC can implement dynamic pricing to better match supply and demand, minimise fair disputes (increase customer trust) and thereby save time and admiminstrative costs.

#### Questions

Some questions to be considered wheen moving forward with project may include:
* What is the current condition of the dataset? Does it require excessive cleaning? Is there a need for validation checks to see for any missing or null values?
* What variables should be considered that could be useful in predicting taxi fares? Time of day? Distance? Demand level?
* What are the trends or insights that can assist in our findings?
* Have we analysed the data objectively? Are there some bias considerations?

#### Resources

Some of the resources required are hardware/software needs like:
* Python notebook software
* The dataset
* maplotlib, tabalaeu etc. that might be required depending on project progress

#### Deliverables
* Project Plan to be sent to stakeholders
* The PACE Strategy Document to be shared with the team to stream workflows
* The prepped dataset free from errors and proper structure using categorisation, aggregation methods (using EDA) etc.
* Regression analysis, appropriate machine learnign model and data visualisation to gather insights
